# Here's a bash example to show just how simple these scripts can be
# Assuming we have flat network with everything on a single switch, we can fake a rack topology.
# This could occur in a lab environment where we have limited nodes,like 2-8 physical machines on a unmanaged switch.
# This may also apply to multiple virtual machines running on the same physical hardware.
# The number of machines isn't important, but that we are trying to fake a network topology when there isn't one.

#       +----------+    +--------+
#       |jobtracker|    |datanode|
#       +----------+    +--------+
#              \        /
#  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+
#  |datanode|--| switch |--|datanode|
#  +--------+  +--------+  +--------+
#              /        \

#       |datanode|    |namenode|
#       +--------+    +--------+

# With this network topology, we are treating each host as a rack.  This is being done by taking the last octet
# in the datanode's IP and prepending it with the word '/rack-'.  The advantage for doing this is so HDFS
# can create its 'off-rack' block copy.
# 1) 'echo $@' will echo all ARGV values to xargs.
# 2) 'xargs' will enforce that we print a single argv value per line
# 3) 'awk' will split fields on dots and append the last field to the string '/rack-'. If awk
#    fails to split on four dots, it will still print '/rack-' last field value

echo $@ | xargs -n 1 | awk -F '.' '{print "/rack-"$NF}'
